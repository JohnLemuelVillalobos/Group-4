            Structuring code is an important aspect of software development
        as it helps to organize code in a way that makes it easy to read,
        understand, and maintain. Here are some general guidelines to consider
        when structuring your code:

            Use a modular approach: Divide your code into smaller, more manageable
        modules, which can be easily tested and reused in other parts of your application.
        This helps to reduce the complexity of your code and makes it easier to maintain.

            Follow a consistent naming convention:
        Use a consistent naming convention for your variables, functions,
        classes, and other components. This makes it easier for other developers
        to understand your code and helps to avoid confusion.

            Use comments to explain your code: Add comments
        to your code to explain what your code is doing and why.
        This helps other developers to understand your code and makes it easier to maintain.

            Use meaningful variable and function names:
        Use variable and function names that are descriptive and meaningful.
        This helps to make your code more readable and easier to understand.

            Separate your concerns: Keep related code together and separate unrelated code.
        This helps to reduce complexity and makes it easier to maintain.

            Follow a consistent coding style: Follow a consistent coding style,
        such as the style recommended by your programming language or framework.
        This helps to make your code more readable and easier to understand.

            Use version control: Use a version control system, such as Git, to manage your code.
        This helps to keep track of changes to your code and makes it easier to collaborate
        with other developers.

                Overall, structuring your code requires a combination of good coding practices and a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. By following these guidelines, you can make your code more readable, understandable, and maintainable.
